	abstract = {Over the past few years, the scientific community, as well as the world’s coatings industry has seen the introduction of oxide/polymer-based superhydrophobic surfaces and coatings with exceptional water repellency. Online videos have caught the public’s imagination by showing people walking through mud puddles without getting their tennis shoes wet or muddy, and water literally flying off coated surfaces. This article attempts to explain the basics of this behavior and to discuss and explain the latest superhydrophobic technological breakthroughs. Since superhydrophobic surfaces and coatings can fundamentally change how water interacts with surfaces, and the fact that earth is a water world, it can legitimately be said that this technology has the potential to literally change the world.},

	abstract = {We report a theoretical and simulation study of the drying and wetting phase transitions of a truncated Lennard-Jones fluid at a flat structureless wall. Binding potential calculations predict that the nature of these transitions depends on whether the wall-fluid attraction has a long ranged (LR) power law decay or is instead truncated, rendering it short ranged (SR). Using grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation and classical density functional theory, we examine both cases in detail. We find that for the LR case wetting is first order, while drying is continuous (critical) and occurs exactly at zero attractive wall strength, i.e., in the limit of a hard wall. In the SR case, drying is also critical but the order of the wetting transition depends on the truncation range of the wall-fluid potential. We characterize the approach to critical drying and wetting in terms of the density and local compressibility profiles and via the finite-size scaling properties of the probability distribution of the overall density. For the LR case, where the drying point is known exactly, this analysis allows us to estimate the exponent ν∥, which controls the parallel correlation length, i.e., the extent of vapor bubbles at the wall. Surprisingly, the value we obtain is over twice that predicted by mean field and renormalization group calculations, despite the fact that our three dimensional system is at the upper critical dimension where mean field theory for critical exponents is expected to hold. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed in the light of fresh insights into the nature of near critical finite-size effects.},

We elucidate the physics of hydrophobic and hydrophilic substrates in terms of wetting and drying surface phase diagrams. These display a surprising variety of forms that depend upon the nature of the substrate–liquid and liquid–liquid attractive forces. Liquids near weakly attractive substrates exhibit critical drying, a phenomenon occurring as

            Clarifying the factors that control the contact angle of a liquid on a solid substrate is a long-standing scientific problem pertinent across physics, chemistry, and materials science. Progress has been hampered by the lack of a comprehensive and unified understanding of the physics of wetting and drying phase transitions. Using various theoretical and simulational techniques applied to realistic fluid models, we elucidate how the character of these transitions depends sensitively on both the range of fluid–fluid and substrate–fluid interactions and the temperature. Our calculations uncover previously unrecognized classes of surface phase diagram which differ from that established for simple lattice models and often assumed to be universal. The differences relate both to the topology of the phase diagram and to the nature of the transitions, with a remarkable feature being a difference between drying and wetting transitions which persists even in the approach to the bulk critical point. Most experimental and simulational studies of liquids at a substrate belong to one of these previously unrecognized classes. We predict that while there appears to be nothing particularly special about water with regard to its wetting and drying behavior, superhydrophobic behavior should be more readily observable in experiments conducted at high temperatures than at room temperature.},

              We study wetting droplets formed of active Brownian particles in contact with a repulsive potential barrier, in a wedge geometry. Our numerical results demonstrate a transition between partially wet and completely wet states, as a function of the barrier height, analogous to the corresponding surface phase transition in passive fluids. We analyse partially wet configurations characterised by a nonzero contact angle
              θ
              between the droplet surface and the barrier including the average density profile and its fluctuations. These findings are compared with two equilibrium systems: a Lennard-Jones fluid and a simple contour model for a liquid–vapour interface. We locate the wetting transition where cos(
              θ
              ) = 1, and the neutral state where cos(
              θ
              ) = 0. We discuss the implications of these results for possible definitions of surface tensions in active fluids.},
