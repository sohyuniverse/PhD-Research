	abstract = {Self-propelled particles include both self-phoretic synthetic colloids and various microorganisms. By continually consuming energy, they bypass the laws of equilibrium thermodynamics. These laws enforce the Boltzmann distribution in thermal equilibrium: The steady state is then independent of kinetic parameters. In contrast, self-propelled particles tend to accumulate where they move more slowly. They may also slow down at high density for either biochemical or steric reasons. This creates positive feedback, which can lead to motilityinduced phase separation (MIPS) between dense and dilute fluid phases. At leading order in gradients, a mapping relates variablespeed, self-propelled particles to passive particles with attractions. This deep link to equilibrium phase separation is confirmed by simulations but generally breaks down at higher order in gradients: New effects, with no equilibrium counterpart, then emerge. We give a selective overview of the fast-developing field of MIPS, focusing on theory and simulation but including a brief speculative survey of its experimental implications.},

	abstract = {A tutorial introduction to the statistical mechanics of phase transitions and phase coexistence is presented, starting out from equilibrium systems and nonequilibrium steady-state situations in externally driven systems, such as unmixing of sheared binary fluid mixtures, the driven lattice gas model, and the onset of Rayleigh-BÃ©nard convection. Then, some models for phase separation in models for active systems, where particles possess internal motility, are discussed, emphasizing what one can learn by extending analysis methods to study phase transitions in equilibrium systems by computer simulations to active systems. Specific examples will include colloidpolymer mixtures where the colloids are assumed to be active particles, and active Brownian particles. The extent to which concepts familiar from the study of equilibrium systems are still useful will be critically discussed.},
