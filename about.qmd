# Purpose of this Website
As I ended week 2 on the 27th of September, I thought it would be useful to keep track of the following from next week (week 3):

1. What I did every day (mostly bookmarking or a summary)
2. A brief summary of what was discussed in project meetings
3. Things I hope to discuss or ask in the next project meeting
4. Useful resources as links, since I often don't keep track of what I bookmarked in Safari
