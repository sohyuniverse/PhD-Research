    "text": "2024/10/4 - Hydrophobicity Across Length Scales: The Role of Surface Criticality\nBy Mary Kathryn Coe\n\nQ1. Resolved\n\n\n\nOn page 35, Chapter 2.1\n\n\nI’m not entirely sure why the surface tension is defined in that way, as it’s normally considered force per unit area. So, I asked ChatGPT:\n\n\nClick to reveal the answer!\n\nThe definition of surface tension in this context is derived from the thermodynamic perspective, which connects surface tension to the grand potential difference between a bulk fluid and a system with an interface. The reasoning follows these steps:\n\nGrand Potential Definition: The grand potential, \\(\\Omega\\), is given by: \\[\n\\Omega = U - TS - \\mu N\n\\] This expression is crucial for systems where particle number and volume are allowed to fluctuate, such as liquid-vapour interfaces.\nSurface Tension from Thermodynamics: Surface tension, \\(\\gamma\\), represents the energy cost per unit area to create an interface. In thermodynamic terms, this corresponds to how much the grand potential increases when introducing an interface between coexisting phases (liquid and vapour).\nDifference between Bulk and Interface: The bulk grand potential, \\(\\Omega_b\\), corresponds to a system without an interface (uniform bulk). When an interface is introduced, the grand potential changes, denoted as \\(\\Omega_{\\text{ex}}\\), the excess grand potential: \\[\n\\Omega_{\\text{ex}} = \\Omega - \\Omega_b\n\\]\nSurface Tension as Excess Grand Potential per Unit Area: The surface tension is then defined as the excess grand potential per unit area, \\(A\\), required to form the interface: \\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{\\Omega_{\\text{ex}}}{A} = \\frac{\\Omega - \\Omega_b}{A}\n\\] This formulation makes sense because surface tension describes the energetic cost to create a unit area of interface between two phases.\n\nIn summary, while surface tension is often discussed in terms of force per unit length in simpler mechanical contexts, in thermodynamics, it is expressed as the excess grand potential per unit area. This ties into how interfaces modify the system’s energy in comparison to the bulk. The two definitions are equivalent but applied in different contexts: mechanical (force/length) vs. thermodynamic (energy/area).\n\n\n\nDerivation of equation 2.1.8, 2.1.9, 2.1.10\n\n\\[\n\\Omega_b(\\mu, V, T) = U - TS - \\mu N = -pV\n\\]\nTaking the differential:\n\\[\nd\\Omega_b = d(U - TS - \\mu N)\n\\]\nUsing the first law of thermodynamics:\n\\[\ndU = TdS - pdV + \\mu dN\n\\]\nDifferentiating \\(TS\\):\n\\[\nd(TS) = TdS + SdT\n\\]\nDifferentiating \\(\\mu N\\):\n\\[\nd(\\mu N) = \\mu dN + N d\\mu\n\\]\nSubstituting these into the differential for \\(\\Omega_b\\):\n\\[\nd\\Omega_b = (TdS - pdV + \\mu dN) - (TdS + SdT) - (\\mu dN + N d\\mu)\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\nd\\Omega_b = -S_b dT - N_b d\\mu - p dV\n\\]\nFor constant volume (\\(dV = 0\\)), the volume is assumed to remain constant because we are focusing on surface effects rather than bulk volume changes.:\n\\[\nd\\Omega_b = -S_b dT - N_b d\\mu\n\\]\nNow for equation (2.1.6):\n\\[\n\\Omega(\\mu, V, T) = U - TS - \\mu N = -pV + \\gamma A\n\\]\nTaking the differential:\n\\[\nd\\Omega = d(U - TS - \\mu N + \\gamma A)\n\\]\nSubstituting differentials:\n\\[\nd\\Omega = TdS - pdV + \\mu dN - (TdS + SdT) - (\\mu dN + N d\\mu) + \\gamma dA + A d\\gamma\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\nd\\Omega = -S dT - N d\\mu + \\gamma dA\n\\]\nNow subtract:\n\\[\nd\\Omega - d\\Omega_b = (-S dT - N d\\mu + \\gamma dA) - (-S_b dT - N_b d\\mu)\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\nd\\Omega - d\\Omega_b = -(S - S_b)dT - (N - N_b)d\\mu + \\gamma dA\n\\]\nThis is equation (2.1.8).\n\nFrom equation (2.1.7):\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{\\Omega_{\\text{ex}}}{A} = \\frac{\\Omega - \\Omega_b}{A}\n\\]\nTaking the differential:\n\\[\nd\\gamma = \\frac{d\\Omega_{\\text{ex}}}{A} = \\frac{d\\Omega - d\\Omega_b}{A}\n\\]\nNow, use the result from equation (2.1.8):\n\\[\nd\\Omega - d\\Omega_b = -(S - S_b) dT - (N - N_b) d\\mu + \\gamma dA\n\\]\nSo:\n\\[\nd\\Omega_{\\text{ex}} = -s_{\\text{ex}} A dT - \\Gamma d\\mu + \\gamma dA\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(s_{\\text{ex}} = \\frac{S - S_b}{A}\\) is the surface excess entropy per unit area,\n\\(\\Gamma = N - N_b\\) is the excess number of particles (adsorption).\n\nDividing through by \\(A\\), we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\Omega_{\\text{ex}}}{A} = -s_{\\text{ex}} dT - \\frac{\\Gamma}{A} d\\mu + \\gamma \\frac{dA}{A}\n\\]\nNow, using the fact that \\(\\gamma \\frac{dA}{A}\\) is small for constant area, we can ignore this term, giving:\n\\[\ns_{\\text{ex}} dT + \\frac{\\Gamma}{A} d\\mu + d\\gamma = 0\n\\]\nThis is equation (2.1.9).\n\nRearrange equation (2.1.9):\n\\[\n\\frac{\\Gamma}{A} d\\mu = -s_{\\text{ex}} dT - d\\gamma\n\\]\nAt constant temperature (\\(dT = 0\\)), this simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\Gamma}{A} d\\mu = -d\\gamma\n\\]\nNow, dividing both sides by \\(d\\mu\\), we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\Gamma}{A} = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\gamma}{\\partial \\mu}\\right)_T\n\\]\nThis is equation (2.1.10).\n\nAnd I need to ask about equations 2.1.11 to 2.1.13, as I cannot find reference [40].\n\n\nQ2. Resolved\n\n\n\nOn page 40, Chapter 2.3\n\n\nI wasn’t sure what the one-particle density is or its use, so I asked ChatGPT:\n\n\nClick to reveal the answer!\n\nThe one-particle density function, often denoted as \\(\\rho^{(1)}(\\mathbf{r})\\), represents the probability density of finding a particle at a specific position \\(\\mathbf{r}\\) in a system of particles. It describes how particles are distributed in space on average and is a key observable in statistical mechanics and the study of fluids.\nThe equation given is:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\rho}^{(1)}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\delta(\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}_j)\n\\]\nThis is the one-particle density operator, and it has the following meaning:\n\nDirac Delta Function: \\(\\delta(\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}_j)\\) is a Dirac delta function that ‘picks out’ the position of the \\(j\\)-th particle. It is equal to zero everywhere except at \\(\\mathbf{r}_j\\), where it is infinite, ensuring that it integrates to 1. Thus, it counts the presence of a particle at \\(\\mathbf{r}_j\\).\nSummation over All Particles: The sum runs over all particles \\(j\\) from 1 to \\(N\\), so this operator adds up the contributions from all particles in the system, effectively counting the number of particles at position \\(\\mathbf{r}\\).\n\nIn essence, the one-particle density operator \\(\\hat{\\rho}^{(1)}(\\mathbf{r})\\) gives the total number of particles at position \\(\\mathbf{r}\\) in the system. Since it is an operator, the actual one-particle density \\(\\langle \\hat{\\rho}^{(1)}(\\mathbf{r}) \\rangle\\), as defined in equation (2.3.2), is obtained by averaging over all possible configurations of the system in the given ensemble (such as the grand canonical ensemble).\nWhy Does It Look Like This?\nThe form of equation (2.3.1) stems from how we represent the microscopic distribution of particles in space. The Dirac delta function ensures that for each particle, its position contributes to the overall density only at the exact location where that particle exists. This is a standard way to construct density operators in statistical mechanics because:\n\nThe delta function precisely pinpoints the position of a particle.\nSumming over all particles ensures that the density operator accounts for the total number of particles present in the system.\n\nThis representation allows us to describe spatially inhomogeneous systems where the density may vary across different regions (e.g., near a surface or an external potential). For homogeneous fluids, where particles are evenly distributed, this density would reduce to a constant value (the bulk density \\(\\rho_b\\)).\nSummary\nThe one-particle density operator, \\(\\hat{\\rho}^{(1)}(\\mathbf{r})\\), reflects how particles are distributed in space at a microscopic level. The delta functions track the positions of individual particles, and summing over all particles gives the total density at position \\(\\mathbf{r}\\). The actual one-particle density function \\(\\rho^{(1)}(\\mathbf{r})\\) is then the ensemble average of this operator over all configurations of the system.\n\n\n\nQ3. Resolved\n\n\n\nOn page 43, Chapter 2.3\n\n\nI wasn’t sure why each variable is specifically chosen to form those equations. For example, in section 2.4.3, I do not understand why λ can be factored out of g on the right-hand side when λ has two different exponents, a and b. So, I asked ChatGPT:\n\n\nClick to reveal the answer!\n\nStarting with Equation (2.4.3):\n\\[\ng(\\lambda^a u, \\lambda^b v) = \\lambda g(u, v)\n\\]\nThis equation states that the function \\(g(u, v)\\) is a generalised homogeneous function. To understand why it takes this form and why \\(\\lambda\\) appears outside the function on the right-hand side, let’s break this down:\n\nHomogeneous Functions: A function is called homogeneous of degree \\(\\alpha\\) if, when all its arguments are scaled by a factor \\(\\lambda\\), the function itself scales by \\(\\lambda^\\alpha\\). Mathematically, for a homogeneous function \\(f(x, y)\\), we would have: \\[\nf(\\lambda x, \\lambda y) = \\lambda^\\alpha f(x, y)\n\\] This property is common in critical phenomena where we are dealing with power-law behaviour near critical points.\nGeneralised Homogeneous Functions: The function \\(g(u, v)\\) is a generalised homogeneous function because it allows different exponents for different variables. In this case, the variables \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) scale with different exponents \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) under the same scaling factor \\(\\lambda\\).\n\n\\(\\lambda^a u\\): Here, \\(u\\) is scaled by \\(\\lambda^a\\). This implies that \\(u\\) behaves differently under scaling compared to \\(v\\).\n\\(\\lambda^b v\\): Similarly, \\(v\\) is scaled by \\(\\lambda^b\\).\n\nWhy \\(\\lambda\\) can be factored out: The key to understanding why \\(\\lambda\\) can be factored out on the right-hand side despite having different exponents for \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) lies in the definition of a generalised homogeneous function. By construction, we impose that when the variables are scaled in a particular way (with exponents \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)), the function scales by \\(\\lambda\\) itself. This is a property we assign to \\(g(u, v)\\). It doesn’t mean that \\(\\lambda\\) is constant; rather, the entire function \\(g(u, v)\\) is designed to respond to the scaling in this specific manner.\nThe exponents \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) control how \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) individually respond to scaling, but the overall response of the function is to scale as \\(\\lambda\\). The scaling of the function on the right-hand side doesn’t contradict the fact that \\(\\lambda\\) has different exponents inside the arguments. This is simply a mathematical constraint on how the function \\(g(u, v)\\) behaves under scaling.\nIn other words, the form: \\[\ng(\\lambda^a u, \\lambda^b v)\n\\] ensures that the function scales uniformly by \\(\\lambda\\), despite the individual variables scaling differently.\n\nEquation (2.4.4):\nNow, let’s explain how this scaling idea applies to the singular part of the free energy in equation (2.4.4):\n\\[\n\\omega_{\\text{sing}}(\\delta \\mu, t) = \\lambda^{-d} \\omega_{\\text{sing}}(\\lambda^a \\delta \\mu, \\lambda^b t)\n\\]\n\nVariables:\n\n\\(\\delta \\mu = \\mu - \\mu_{\\text{co}}\\) is the difference between the chemical potential \\(\\mu\\) and the critical chemical potential \\(\\mu_{\\text{co}}\\).\n\\(t\\) is the reduced temperature: \\(t = \\frac{T - T_c}{T_c}\\).\n\\(d\\) is the dimensionality of the system (important for scaling relations).\n\nApplying the Scaling Relation: Here, the function \\(\\omega_{\\text{sing}}\\), which represents the singular part of the free energy, is assumed to be a generalised homogeneous function. This means it should follow a scaling law similar to the one introduced in equation (2.4.3).\nThe variables \\(\\delta \\mu\\) and \\(t\\) are scaled by \\(\\lambda^a\\) and \\(\\lambda^b\\), respectively, where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are scaling exponents that determine how \\(\\delta \\mu\\) and \\(t\\) change when scaled by \\(\\lambda\\).\nWhy \\(\\lambda^{-d}\\)?\n\nThe factor \\(\\lambda^{-d}\\) appears because we are dealing with free energy, which is an extensive quantity. In thermodynamics, extensive quantities scale with the volume of the system, and in \\(d\\)-dimensional space, the volume scales as \\(\\lambda^d\\). Since we are dealing with the singular part of the free energy, the scaling reflects the dimensionality of the system. The minus sign arises because, under scaling, the free energy decreases as the system grows larger.\n\nThe Free Choice of \\(\\lambda\\): The scaling factor \\(\\lambda\\) is arbitrary, meaning you can choose its value to simplify the equation. In this case, we choose \\(\\lambda^b = t^{-1}\\), which simplifies the second argument (the temperature dependence) of \\(\\omega_{\\text{sing}}\\). By doing this, we reduce the complexity of the equation and make the temperature scaling explicit.\n\nEquation (2.4.5):\nThis equation shows the final form after choosing \\(\\lambda^b = t^{-1}\\):\n\\[\n\\omega_{\\text{sing}}(\\delta \\mu, t) = t^{d/b} \\omega_{\\text{sing}}(t^{-a/b} \\delta \\mu, 1)\n\\]\n\nWhy this form? By setting \\(\\lambda^b = t^{-1}\\), we have scaled out the temperature dependence in the second argument of \\(\\omega_{\\text{sing}}\\). This isolates the temperature dependence into the prefactor \\(t^{d/b}\\), while leaving a scaling function that depends only on the ratio \\(\\delta \\mu / t^{a/b}\\), which is now the only scaling variable.\n\n\\(t^{d/b}\\): This represents how the singular part of the free energy depends on temperature near the critical point. The exponent \\(d/b\\) dictates how strongly the free energy diverges as \\(t \\to 0\\) (the critical point).\n\\(\\Sigma\\left( \\frac{\\delta \\mu}{t^{a/b}} \\right)\\): The function \\(\\Sigma\\) is the scaling function, which encodes the remaining dependence on the scaled chemical potential \\(\\delta \\mu / t^{a/b}\\).\n\n\nIn Summary: - In equation (2.4.3), the exponents \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) control how the variables \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) scale. Despite their different scaling behaviours, the overall function scales by \\(\\lambda\\) because it is designed as a generalised homogeneous function. - In equation (2.4.4), the singular part of the free energy near the critical point follows a similar scaling law, with the dimensionality \\(d\\) appearing as a factor to reflect the extensive nature of free energy. - In equation (2.4.5), we choose \\(\\lambda^b = t^{-1}\\) to simplify the scaling form, making the dependence on temperature explicit and reducing the complexity of the equation. The resulting expression separates the prefactor \\(t^{d/b}\\) and leaves a scaling function that depends only on the ratio \\(\\delta \\mu / t^{a/b}\\), which captures the critical behaviour.\n\n\n\nFluctuations? One correlated entity?\n\nIn the context of phase transitions, particularly near a critical point, the term “fluctuations” refers to fluctuations in the local density of the system. Let’s explain in detail what this means, especially in the context of critical opalescence and long-range correlations.\n\nDensity Fluctuations: When we talk about “density” in this context, we mean the number density of particles in a given volume. In simple terms, it’s how densely packed the particles are in a particular region. The density can fluctuate due to thermal motion, and these fluctuations are typically small and localised in non-critical conditions.\n\nHowever, as a system approaches the critical point of a phase transition (e.g., a liquid-vapour transition), the magnitude of these fluctuations grows dramatically.\n\nWhat happens near the critical point?\n\nCorrelation Length (\\(\\xi\\)): The correlation length \\(\\xi\\) represents the distance over which particles in the system are correlated or “communicate” with each other. Normally, this length is finite, and beyond this distance, the properties of the system in one region do not affect another region.\nNear the critical point, however, \\(\\xi \\to \\infty\\). This means that particles separated by very large distances (even macroscopic scales) are correlated with each other. The entire system essentially becomes one correlated entity.\nDiverging Fluctuations: As the correlation length grows, the fluctuations in the local density (i.e., how many particles are in a given region at any time) also grow larger. This happens because, when the correlation length is large, particles across large distances influence each other. As a result, fluctuations occur over all length scales, from small to very large.\nDensity Fluctuations: Specifically, these are fluctuations in the number of particles in a given volume. Imagine regions in a fluid where the particle density becomes temporarily higher or lower than the average. At the critical point, these fluctuations become very large and occur over very large distances, leading to the system appearing “cloudy” or “milky” — this is the phenomenon of critical opalescence.\n\n\nWhat exactly is fluctuating? At the critical point, density is the key fluctuating quantity, but more generally, the term “fluctuations” can refer to:\n\n\nOrder Parameter Fluctuations: Near a critical point, there is typically an order parameter that characterises the phase transition. For example, in the liquid-vapour transition, this order parameter could be the difference in density between the liquid and vapour phases. As the system approaches the critical point, the fluctuations in the order parameter become large.\nFor example, in a fluid near the liquid-vapour critical point:\n\nIn the liquid phase, particles are densely packed.\nIn the vapour phase, particles are more spread out.\n\nNear the critical point, there is no sharp distinction between liquid and vapour phases. Instead, the system fluctuates between states that resemble both phases. You might see a region that has the density of a liquid next to a region that has the density of a vapour, and these regions appear and disappear rapidly.\n\n\nWhy do these fluctuations occur? At the critical point, the system is in a delicate balance between two phases (e.g., liquid and vapour). The free energy landscape becomes very flat near the critical point, meaning that the system can fluctuate easily between different configurations with very little energy cost. These fluctuations span all length scales, leading to the phenomenon where large regions of the system can fluctuate in density.\nCritical Opalescence: The critical opalescence mentioned in the text is a direct consequence of these large fluctuations in density. Light passing through the fluid is scattered by the density fluctuations. Since the fluctuations occur over a wide range of length scales (from very small to very large), they scatter light across all wavelengths, leading to the “milky” appearance of the fluid near the critical point.\n\n\nWhy does light scatter? Light is scattered by regions of varying density because the refractive index of the fluid depends on its density. When the density fluctuates significantly over large distances, light passing through the fluid encounters regions of different densities, leading to scattering in all directions.\n\nSummary:\n\nWhat is fluctuating near the critical point?: Primarily, the number density (i.e., the number of particles per unit volume) fluctuates near the critical point.\nWhy do these fluctuations grow?: As the correlation length \\(\\xi\\) becomes large, regions of the system separated by large distances become correlated, allowing large-scale fluctuations in density.\nWhat’s the physical manifestation?: These fluctuations lead to observable phenomena such as critical opalescence, where light is scattered by the large fluctuations in density, causing the fluid to appear milky or cloudy.\n\nIn short, the “fluctuations” near the critical point refer to density fluctuations, which are tied to the divergence of the correlation length, and these fluctuations grow larger and affect larger regions of the system as the critical point is approached.\n\n\nFrom chapter 2.4.3, I decided to skim through this document as it became too technical to understand the entire thesis when it began with perturbation theory. Additionally, many concepts here are primarily from equilibrium statistical physics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nChapter 2.4.5: Wetting and Drying Phase Transitions is very well written and full of useful knowledge. For the next project meeting, let’s prepare a slide to go over this.\n\n\nWetting and Drying Phase Transitions",

In the troposphere (the lowest layer of the atmosphere), clouds form when the air cools to its dew point, causing water vapour to condense into droplets or ice crystals. This typically happens at specific altitudes where temperature and pressure conditions are ideal for condensation.\nClouds that seem to form at the same height are likely part of the same atmospheric layer, known as a cloud base. The cloud base marks the altitude at which rising air reaches its dew point. If the conditions across the sky are uniform, we’ll see many clouds forming at roughly the same altitude, giving the illusion of a flat layer of clouds.\nCloud formation is fundamentally a non-equilibrium process. It results from dynamic atmospheric conditions like rising air currents, changes in temperature and pressure, and the continuous exchange of energy. These factors drive processes such as condensation and evaporation, which are inherently out of equilibrium. This aligns with the behaviour of active matter systems, where each particle consumes energy to move, keeping the system perpetually out of equilibrium.\nTo create an effective repulsion in our ABP simulations, we consider modifying the wall-fluid interactions to induce a torque that reorients particles away from the surface. One approach might be to introduce an anisotropic interaction potential near the wall. When an ABP approaches the surface, this potential could apply a torque that turns the particle’s propulsion direction away from the wall, effectively reducing its tendency to accumulate there.\n\n\n\n2024/10/5 An idea of beginning the introduction\nThis thesis is ultimately about phase transitions. The central question is: what happens during a transition, for example, from water to ice, from a fluid to a superfluid, or from a paramagnet to a ferromagnet? The physics of such transitions is rich and complex. There are a number of different theoretical tools available to understand them. The study begins by examining thermodynamics and extends to the application of statistical mechanics to these transitions. Additionally, statistical field theory, a fully-fledged field theory similar to what is seen in particle physics or general relativity, will be applied. The goal is to use these approaches, along with concepts of symmetry and other properties, to understand different phases of matter.\nFor a long time, understanding phase transitions was a mystery, especially what’s known as a critical point. It’s an interesting situation: we have something as familiar as water, and it was not until the mid-20th century that significant progress was made. The phase behaviour of water can be examined using a pressure-temperature diagram:\n\n\n\nPhase diagram of water (Cmglee n.d.)\n\nCmglee. n.d. “Phase Diagram of Water Simplified.” https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Phase_diagram_of_water_simplified.svg.\n\n\n\nOn the horizontal axis is temperature, and on the vertical axis is pressure.\nThe phase diagram for water features three regions: steam, water, and ice.\nThere’s a point called the triple point, where all three phases coexist, and a critical point, which marks the end of the liquid-gas boundary.\n\nWater is essential, as most of us are mostly water, and yet the physics of what happens at this critical point wasn’t understood for the longest time. It’s a system that is incredibly close to us, yet to understand it requires some of the deepest ideas in physics, particularly the renormalisation group.\nIn this sense, phase transitions form a uniquely positioned subject. They are simultaneously very close to our everyday experience and yet require extremely deep ideas to understand properly. Most other areas of physics are typically far removed from daily life. Quantum mechanics operates on microscopic scales, and astrophysics on cosmological scales, both far from what can be intuitively grasped. But here, some really deep, beautiful puzzles are found in the world around us.",

Found one: Link\n\n\n\n\n2024/10/8 Analytical Mechanics\nI’ve been watching Tom’s lectures on Analytical Mechanics once more. I’ve just finished part 2. The topics are:\n\nCalculus of variations\nLagrangian mechanics\nHamiltonian mechanics\n\nWhy did I start watching it?\nWell, during the last project meeting, I had a naïve question about whether we could formulate a Lagrangian for the drying scenario. For example, in my supervisor’s papers, they couldn’t manage to observe the drying transition in their setup. So, I asked if, when the trajectory of all particles is away from the surface, we could possibly derive an analytical equation of forces between the particles and the wall to induce torque. Just a pure naïve idea.\nNigel mentioned that the principle of least action makes sense in equilibrium settings, so I had to revise that concept. The Lagrangian is the kinetic energy minus the potential energy, whatever this quantity is. In non-equilibrium systems, energy keeps changing since active agents continuously consume energy. Also, the effective potential depends on the properties of the wall. So, the Lagrangian would become time-dependent, which now makes sense based on what Nigel said.\nThe beautiful theorem was revisited from his lectures: Noether’s theorem.\n\nIf the laws of physics don’t depend on time, energy is conserved.\nSimilarly, if the system has translational or rotational invariance, momentum or angular momentum is conserved, respectively.\n\nThis is beautiful: conserved quantities derive from the symmetries of the system. It also implies that since energy is not conserved for the system I’m interested in, the equations of motion would be time-dependent. I think it would be useful to pay attention to how the equations of motion for active Brownian particles are formulated once I revise their papers.\nAs for his lectures, I’ll continue with part 3 since I’ve already watched the first two. That said, I remember his lecture notes being better than the video recordings, although his video lectures on phase transitions were much more inspiring. So, a note for my future self: when revising the content of the analytical formulation of mechanics, read his lecture notes.\n\n\nPrograms I made\nBefore doing that, I made a Python program that:\n\ndownloads all lectures from Mediasite from the unit I select,\ndetects and removes sections of silence in both the video and audio tracks, applying a buffer of 0.5 seconds before and after each silence to make the transitions smoother,\nsyncs the video and audio together seamlessly to create an mp4 file (the original files were mov, which were almost 10x larger in size),\nkeeps the system active throughout the process by using caffeinate to prevent the computer from going to sleep,\ntracks and reports the download status, ensuring that any interrupted downloads are handled smoothly by automatically updating cookies for authentication,\nensures frame rate consistency to avoid any sync issues that might arise due to different frame rates,\nautomatically manages temporary files created during the silence detection process, keeping the system clean after the task is done.\n\nI’m not sure if I’m allowed to share this code on GitHub, but it was a fun project.\n\n\n\nDownloaded lectures\n\n\nWhy did I make it? Because…\n\nI’ve always felt lazy logging into Blackboard (the university website) every time I wanted to watch videos during my undergraduate years.\nI personally wanted to collect the lectures before they disappeared from the website.\nThere are many pauses in the lectures where the lecturer doesn’t speak while writing equations or words. Removing these pauses also saves total viewing time. Observe the difference:\n\nTotal time to watch all videos of AM (Analytical Mechanics):\n\nAM: 9 hours, 18 minutes, 34 seconds\nProcessed_AM: 8 hours, 23 minutes, 50 seconds\nProcessed_AM (no buffer of 0.5s): 7 hours, 23 minutes, 28 seconds\n\nTotal time to watch all videos of PT (Physics of Phase Transitions):\n\nPT: 11 hours, 42 minutes, 19 seconds\nProcessed_PT: 10 hours, 49 minutes, 18 seconds\nProcessed_PT (no buffer of 0.5s): 9 hours, 45 minutes, 29 seconds\n\nThe buffer is necessary as it makes the transitions feel more natural by introducing a brief pause rather than cutting the silences completely. Watch an example below (duration change: 18:09 (before processing) → 15:29 (after processing with buffers)):\n\n\nVideo\nAM 2.5a Noether’s Theorem\n\n\n\n\n\n2024/10/12 Making a presentation\n\nIntroduction\nIn this presentation, I’m going to explain the theoretical foundations of hydrophobicity by examining wetting and drying phase transitions. The phenomena are driven by surface tension and critical temperature scaling.\n\n\nYoung’s Equation\nConsider a droplet of liquid on a surface. The contact angle, denoted as θ, quantifies the affinity between the liquid and the surface. This angle is determined by resolving the surface tensions of the interfaces involved. The relationship is given by Young’s equation:\n\\[\n\\cos \\theta = \\frac{\\gamma_{sv} - \\gamma_{sl}}{\\gamma_{lv}} \\tag{1}\n\\]\nWhere: - \\(\\gamma_{sv}\\) is the surface-vapour tension - \\(\\gamma_{sl}\\) is the surface-liquid tension - \\(\\gamma_{lv}\\) is the liquid-vapour tension\n\nHydrophobic vs Hydrophilic\n\nHydrophobic surfaces: \\(90^\\circ &lt; \\theta &lt; 180^\\circ\\)\nHydrophilic surfaces: \\(0^\\circ &lt; \\theta &lt; 90^\\circ\\)\n\nAt two extremes:\n\n\\(\\theta = 0^\\circ\\): Full wetting.\n\\(\\theta = 180^\\circ\\): Perfect drying.\n\n\n\n\nSurface Phase Transitions\nThe approach to the two limiting cases represents surface phase transitions—wetting for \\(\\theta = 0^\\circ\\) and drying for \\(\\theta = 180^\\circ\\).\n\nCahn’s Scaling Law\nCahn’s theory explains the scaling behaviour of surface tensions as the critical temperature \\(T_c\\) is approached (see: (Cahn 1977)). The surface tension vanishes following the power law:\n\nCahn, John W. 1977. “Critical Point Wetting.” The Journal of Chemical Physics 66 (8): 3667–72.\n\\[\n\\gamma_{lv} \\sim (-t)^\\mu \\quad \\text{with} \\quad \\mu = (d-1)\\nu\n\\]\nFor a fluid with \\(d = 3\\), the critical exponent is \\(\\nu \\approx 0.63\\), yielding \\(\\mu \\approx 1.26\\).\n\n\nContact Angle Near \\(T_c\\)\nAs \\(T_c\\) is approached, the contact angle vanishes:\n\\[\n\\cos \\theta \\sim t^{\\beta - \\mu} \\quad \\text{with} \\quad \\beta \\approx 0.33\n\\]\nThus, \\(\\cos \\theta\\) diverges as \\(t^{-0.93}\\), but is constrained to \\(|\\cos \\theta| \\leq 1\\).\n\nWhy \\(\\beta - \\mu\\)?\nNear the critical temperature, both \\(\\gamma_{sv}\\) and \\(\\gamma_{sl}\\) vanish. As \\(T\\) approaches \\(T_c\\), \\(\\gamma_{lv}\\) tends to zero as \\((-t)^\\mu\\). The numerator \\(\\gamma_{sv} - \\gamma_{sl}\\) scales with the order parameter difference \\(\\Delta \\rho = \\rho_l - \\rho_v\\), because the distinction between liquid and vapour phases diminishes. This gives:\n\\[\n\\gamma_{sv} - \\gamma_{sl} \\sim (-t)^\\beta\n\\]\nBy substituting the scaling behaviours of \\(\\gamma_{lv}\\) and \\(\\gamma_{sv} - \\gamma_{sl}\\) into Young’s equation, we get:\n\\[\n\\cos \\theta \\sim \\frac{(-t)^\\beta}{(-t)^\\mu} = t^{\\beta - \\mu}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nWetting and Drying Transitions\nThe phase transition occurs at a specific temperature:\n\nWetting occurs at \\(T_W\\), where \\(\\cos \\theta = 1\\).\nDrying occurs at \\(T_D\\), where \\(\\cos \\theta = -1\\).\n\nAt these temperatures, a macroscopic layer of liquid or vapour forms at the surface.\n\nCritical vs First-Order Transitions\nThe nature of these transitions can be:\n\nCritical: The equilibrium film width \\(\\ell_{eq}\\) grows continuously as \\(T_D\\) is approached.\nFirst-order: The film width jumps discontinuously.\n\nBelow are illustrations of critical and first-order transitions for drying:\n\n# Insert visual figure using code or links to diagrams\n\n\n\n\nPredrying Transitions\nIn systems undergoing first-order drying, predrying can occur at temperatures \\(T &gt; T_D\\). In this case, the vapour film transitions from a thin to a thick layer before the full drying transition at \\(T_D\\).\n\nScaling Behaviour\nThe equilibrium film width \\(\\ell_{eq}\\) exhibits different behaviours depending on the order of the transition:\n\\[\n\\ell_{eq} = \\frac{-\\Gamma}{A_{sv} \\Delta \\rho}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(\\Gamma = \\int \\mathrm{d}r \\, [\\rho(r) - \\rho_b]\\) is the adsorption, which describes the excess of fluid near the surface relative to the bulk.\n\\(A_{sv}\\) is the surface area of the substrate-vapour interface\n\\(\\Delta \\rho = \\rho_l - \\rho_v\\) is the difference between the liquid and vapour densities\n\nFor \\(\\rho(r)\\), we know from the statistical mechanics of fluids that the one-particle density \\(\\rho^{(1)}(r)\\) can be written in the form of an ensemble average.:\n\\[\n\\langle \\hat{\\rho}^{(1)}(r) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\Xi} \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{e^{\\beta \\mu N}}{\\Lambda^{3N}(N-1)!} \\int \\mathrm{d}r^{N-1} e^{-\\beta[\\Phi(r^N) + V_{\\text{ext}}(r^N)]}\n\\]\nThis defines the fluid’s spatially varying density at a microscopic level.",

    "text": "In terms of the project on ‘Active Drying’, drying is an equilibrium surface phase transition that occurs when a fluid at liquid-vapour coexistence is in contact with an infinite planar substrate that is sufficiently weakly attractive to the fluid particles, such that the vapour phase prefers to be at the substrate. Surface phase transitions can be first-order or critical, and previous results (see [1, 2]) show that drying is generally a critical surface phase transition.\nPrevious work on ABPs has shown that they can exhibit a first-order wetting transition (see [3]). This effect has been investigated by looking at liquid-vapour ‘slabs’ and droplets, showing consistent results. However, the mechanism by which the wetting transition is traversed does not seem to allow for the possibility of a drying transition. To have a chance of observing this, we need to understand the mechanism by which ABPs interact with a surface.\nThe aggregation effect at a hard wall arises because ABPs become trapped at the wall and cannot diffuse away quickly enough. The project will attempt to induce a drying transition by coupling the ABP velocity vector to the wall-fluid interaction in such a way as to produce a torque that creates an effective wall-fluid repulsion, possibly enabling a drying transition. Our task will be to modify a standard MD simulation package to introduce this torque and then proceed similarly to the Turci and Wilding paper in PRL 2021 (see [4]), to try to observe a drying transition. If evidence for this is seen, then we will try to quantify the character of the transition and analyse its critical properties.",
